[Design]

I implement a key-val pair Hash Table to store all pairs.
Then I implement a LRU Cache, including a Linked List and a Hash Table.
In LRU Cache, Hash Table to hold the key and its prev pointer 
points to the previous node in Cache Linked List.

The size of the Hash Table is 512; The size of LRU Cache is 128.


[Results]

1. result of command "kv_test -f small":

xsh $ set errors: 0, get errors: 0

[Problems]

1. In test cases of big, large, and xlarge, the number of keys are large. It looks like the get operation is correct, however, the info of Cache on number of successful did not show.

2. I didn't freemem in kv_reset. Because if I tried to freemem, the second call to any test cases would crash.

3. I didn't implement the function "most_popular_keys".
