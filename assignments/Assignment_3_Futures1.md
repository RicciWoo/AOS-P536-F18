## Assignment Futures1

#### Description

The aim of this assignment is to understand and implement futures in the Xinu operating system. In this project you will be responsible for developing and testing the system calls required for futures.

#### Futures

Futures are a mechanism for synchronizing on asynchronously produced data, potentially improving the ability to manage concurrent activities efficiently. Please refer to following links for more information:

1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises
2. http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/futures-promises.html

#### Implementation

Use the following code and details to implement futures in the Xinu operating system.

#### Data Structures and Types

    typedef enum {
      FUTURE_EMPTY,
      FUTURE_WAITING,
      FUTURE_READY
    } future_state_t;

    typedef enum {
      FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE,
      FUTURE_SHARED,
      FUTURE_QUEUE
    } future_mode_t;

    typedef struct {
      int value;
      future_state_t state;
      future_mode_t mode;
      pid32 pid;
      yourtype set_queue;
      yourtype get_queue;
    } future_t;

#### Field Descriptions

- value - The value which will be held in future.
- mode - Mode of operation for future. It must be defined while allocating future using future_alloc() For this assignment we will support FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE, FUTURE_QUEUE and FUTURE_SHARED modes.
- FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE - In this mode maximum 2 threads can get involved. One thread will set the value of future and other will get the value of future.
- FUTURE_SHARED - In this mode there is one-to-many relationship between thread calling future_set() and future_get(). Only one thread can call future_set(). Any subsequent calls to future_set() function should throw an error. Many threads can call future_get() function on a future and get the value. All threads waiting on a future for value should be queued in get_queue of the future. As soon as a future is set, all threads waiting in get_queue should be resumed. When you callfuture_free() function to free the future, it will also free the get_queue and destroy it.
- FUTURE_QUEUE - In this mode threads calling future_set() and future_get() share many-to-many relationship. The future implementation will include set_queue and get_queue to hold the information about the waiting threads.You should implement your own queue type. Many threads can call future_set() and future_get(). A future in this mode should behave as follows:
	- If a thread is calling future_set() and there are threads waiting for a value in the get_queue then the thread calling future_set() should set the value and resume only one thread from the get_queue based on first come first serve basis. If there is no thread waiting in the get_queue then thread calling future_set() should enqueue itself in the set_queue.
	- If a thread is calling future_get() and there are threads waiting to set value in the set_queue then thread should release only one thread from the set_queue and should get the value set by thread just released from set_queue. If there is no thread waiting in set_queue to set the value then thread calling future_get() should enqueue itself in the get_queue.
- state - There are 3 valid states for future to be in:
	1. FUTURE_EMPTY – A future allocated for an operation by a call to future_alloc()
	2. FUTURE_WAITING – A future on which a process is waiting, by a call to future_get(), for a value to be assigned
	3. FUTURE_READY – A future that holds a value assigned by a call to future_set()
- pid - Process id of thread waiting for value by calling future_get()

#### The Futures Interface
- future_t* future_alloc(future_mode_t mode) - Allocates a new future (in the FUTURE_EMPTY state) with the given mode. We will use the getmem() call to allocate space to new future.
	- Parameters:
future_mode_t mode - The mode this future will operate in
	- Returns: future_t - NULL or a pointer to a valid future
- syscall future_free(future_t* f) - Frees the allocated future. Use the freemem() system call to free the space.
	- Parameters:
		- future_t* f - future to free
	- Returns: syscall - SYSERR or OK
- syscall future_get(future_t* f, int* value) - Get the value of a future set by an operation and may change the state of future.
	- Parameters:
		- future_t* f - Future on which to wait for and obtain value
		- int* value - Address into which the future's value will be copied.
	- Returns: syscall - SYSERR or OK
- syscall future_set(future_t* f, int value) - Set a value in a future and may change the state of future.
	- Parameters:
		- future_t* f - Future in which to set the value
		- int value - Result of an operation to be set as value in the future
	- Returns: syscall - SYSERR or OK

#### Instructions

1. Copy the future.h code listing below into the include/future.h file.
2. Implement the required functions in the system/future.c file.
3. Modify shell/xsh_prodcons.c to accept a -f flag. When this flag is given the program should use the code listed in Future ProdCons Snippet bellow.
4. Create the file apps/future_prodcons.c and add the future_prod and future_cons functions listed bellow.

#### Code Listings
