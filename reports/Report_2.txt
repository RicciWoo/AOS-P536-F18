Design outline:

1. Use getline to read lines from the file

2. Use strstr check if the line contains the word

3. Test on 2 files, each with more 100,000 lines

4. Use getline to read from standard input (pipe)

5. get number of threads to be used from cammand line

Concurrency design:

1. read from the file or standard input (pipe) once

2. split them evenly into number of threads (upper bound)

3. user specify number of threads to be used
   (I will experiment the best number of threads on silo)

4. also pass the line number to threads for indexing

5. when all results return to main(), sorted them by index
